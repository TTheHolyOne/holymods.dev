	<div class="about">
		<p>Ahh.. this will be a short post.<br /><br />Controversial topic isn't it? Yeah, teachers might think
			censorship is good..<br />Us students don't, GoGuardian, Securly, and anything like those are all
			spyware.<br />They collect information like where you are all the time, it alerts the teachers and admins if
			you are caught searching up things about EMOTIONAL HEALTH<br />Its messed up, it also even blocks topics
			that can help with you school. It will block music sites like spotify..<br />It will block you going on even
			get this... sites about books.<br />It ofcourse can be used for good, like monitoring the students screen
			during a test but if you are going to give a student a computer<br />that they are allowed to take home..
			why would you make it so they couldn't watch say a video at home.. heck like they even block history
			channels.<br />They can even see the students camera if the admin has given access. You might not understand
			how dangerous that it is but it is.<br />Or if a student wants to text there mom after or before
			school<br />They might have to connect to the school wifi, fine right?<br />No, once a student does that,
			the school can see all of your search history, images, texts, and social media accounts. Scary I
			know.<br />So they even monitor a students personal phone.<br/>That is why I decided to join the movement.</p>
